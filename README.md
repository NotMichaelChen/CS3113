CS3113 Homework Repository for Michael Chen (mzc223)

#Build Instructions

All homeworks are completed on a linux (ubuntu 17.10) environment, and each folder comes with a makefile. The opengl libraries (mesa-utils), GLEW (libglew-dev), and SDL (libsdl2-dev, libsdl-image1.2, libsdl-ttf2.0-0, libsdl-mixer1.2) were all used in the makefile. To build the program, simply type `make` while in a homework directory to build an application called "out", which you can then run from the terminal (I was unable to get the application to run by simply double clicking on it)
